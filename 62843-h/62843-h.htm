<p>Every traveler, on first viewing Stone Mountain,
has stood in awe at the foot of the looming
monolith. Seasoned tourists and Georgia school
children are affected just as pioneer explorers were.
The towering rock is so impressive that each
individual feels he is making the great discovery.</p>
<p>Questions arise. How did Stone Mountain come
to be? How old is it, and how high? Exactly how
large is this biggest carving in the world. How was
it done? Who did it? Who first saw Stone Mountain?
What effects has it had on the development of
our country?</p>
<p>Thus, this book. It is dedicated to those who
care enough to see and study the wonders of
their country, and who, in their travels, have had the
unexplainable and unexpected thrill of discovering
Stone Mountain.</p>

<p><i>Stone Mountain&rsquo;s Confederate Memorial is the
world&rsquo;s largest piece of sculpture, cut into the side
of the world&rsquo;s biggest exposed mass of granite.
The carving is 90 feet tall and 190 feet
wide, stands eleven and a half feet out from the
side of the mountain, and towers 400 feet
above the ground in a frame that is 360 feet
square, or three acres. Fifty-five years
elapsed from the time of the original concept in
1915 until completion of the three figures in
1970. Not a blow of the hammer was struck for
36 years, from 1928 to 1964.</i></p>
<p class="tb">At Stone Mountain things have a way of
coming out quite differently than planned.</p>
<p>History is a little hazy on who first
envisioned a Confederate Memorial on Stone
Mountain. Mrs. Helen Plane, charter member of
the United Daughters of the Confederacy, was
quoted in 1909 as thinking it would be a fine place
for a monument. In 1912 John Temple Graves,
editor of the New York American, after a visit back
home wrote a rousing editorial for the Atlanta
Georgian urging that the world&rsquo;s greatest
monument be carved on the world&rsquo;s finest piece
of stone.</p>
<p>Actual movement began in 1915 when Mrs.
Plane, then president of the Atlanta chapter of
UDC, suggested having a 70-foot statue of
General Robert E. Lee carved on the steep side of
the mountain. The UDC consulted Gutzon
Borglum, who just then was being acclaimed for his
statue of Abraham Lincoln. The first look at
Stone Mountain set Borglum&rsquo;s imagination afire.
Here was the biggest, finest solid block of
granite any sculptor ever had an opportunity to
carve. A small figure in its center, he pointed out,
would be like a postage stamp stuck on a barn.</p>
<p>The sculptor stayed several weeks at the
nearby home of Samuel H. Venable, head of the
family that owned the mountain, while he studied
the great stone. Then he drew up sketches of
Confederate leaders riding around the mountain,
which he submitted to a meeting of the UDC.</p>
<p>In 1915 women were not even permitted to
vote. Their principal commercial experience was as
salesladies, telephone girls and seamstresses.
When Borglum said the monument would require
ten years and cost three million dollars, the ladies
were terrified. They wanted no part of such an
undertaking.</p>
<p>On March 20, 1916, Sam Venable,
Mrs. Coribel Venable Kellogg and Mrs.
Robert Venable Roper deeded the face of Stone
Mountain and ten adjoining acres to the UDC,
with the proviso that the property would be
turned back to the original owners if a suitable
monument was not completed in twelve years. At
their Chattanooga convention in 1917 the
UDC ladies founded an independent chartered
organization known as the Stone Mountain
Confederate Monumental Association to manage
the project.</p>
<p>World War I stopped non-essential activities.
In 1923 Borglum announced that his designs
were complete and he was ready to start carving.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s largest sculpture presented many
unprecedented problems. A difficult one was
how to get a sketch of the monument on the
mountainside. Borglum announced that he would
pour chemicals from above to coat the stone with
photographic emulsion, flash an image of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
model through a giant enlarger, and develop the
picture by pouring down more chemicals. By the
time photographers explained to him that it could
not be done, his plan had been described in
magazines and newspapers around the world, and
the Stone Mountain Memorial was news
everywhere. Borglum devised a method for using
the idea, anyway.</p>
<p>There was not even a precedent for determining
the size of the carving. The nearest thing was the
rule that decreed the diameter of court house
clocks. By this scale the statues should be 35 feet
high for viewing from the studio 1,300 feet away.</p>
<p>A crowd collected the evening the projector
was set up. Borglum computed the lens setting to
give a 35-foot-tall image, inserted the plate
bearing a photograph of his model, and switched on
the light. There was a gasp from the spectators.
Horses and men looked like midgets.</p>
<p>Borglum enlarged the image until it
assumed an impressive size, then called to two men,
swinging down the mountain in bos&rsquo;n&rsquo;s chairs,
to measure it. One dangled a tape from the
top. The other, reading the figure at the bottom,
called out, &ldquo;One hundred and sixty-eight feet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men carried buckets of paint and
brushes for outlining the picture; but when they
started to work they could not tell men from
horses nor heads from feet, or where one figure
ended and another began. The next day Borglum
traced the picture of his model as a
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
line drawing on another plate and that night
his aides were able to outline the sketch.</p>
<p>Motor trucks of that period were not
powerful enough to climb Stone Mountain.
Materials needed to construct a stairway from the
top down to the carving site were hauled up the foot
trail by ox cart. After the stairs were finished,
cable, pulley and winch were installed to bring up
materials for stairs down to the ground,
scaffolding and tools.</p>
<p>On June 23, 1923, Borglum led a group of
dignitaries over the top of the mountain and down
to the platform above the carving site. Gov. E.
Lee Trinkle of Virginia made a dedicatory
speech through a megaphone to throngs below.
Then Borglum had himself lowered by bos&rsquo;n&rsquo;s chair
and, with a pneumatic drill, punched several
holes into the mountain as the official beginning of
the carving.</p>

</div>
<p>From the time he started, Borglum had
five years to complete the monument before the end
of the 12-year deadline. On January 19, 1924,
anniversary of Lee&rsquo;s birth, 20,000 gathered for the
unveiling of General Lee&rsquo;s head. On the
previous day a select party, including the governors
of Virginia, Texas and Alabama, had climbed
over the mountain and descended the stairs for a
dinner at a table set up on the granite shelf in
front of the statue.</p>
<p>A few months later work on the carving
began to slow down. Personality rifts between
Borglum and members of the Association widened,
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
and in March, 1925, the sculptor destroyed his
models and sketches, and left Georgia. Other
artists said the real reason for his tantrums was
distortion in the carving&mdash;he never could
have finished it, and he was trying to hide the
blame. Taking a short cut in projecting his sketch
onto the mountain had been a fatal
mistake. He went to South Dakota and
gained lasting fame by carving the Mount
Rushmore masterpiece.</p>
<p>No sign of Borglum&rsquo;s work remains at Stone
Mountain. However, he made a vital contribution.
It is doubtful if any other artist would have
had the imagination to visualize such a stupendous
monument in such an inaccessible place, or
have had the nerve to start carving it.</p>
<p>And he accomplished one thing that lasts. He
designed the Confederate half-dollar. Congress
agreed for the mint to produce five million of
these coins, which, with the Association selling
them for a dollar apiece, could have financed the
carving of the memorial.</p>
<p>The next sculptor selected, Augustus Lukeman,
was the exact antithesis of his predecessor&mdash;a man
of few words and apparently no temperament
whatever.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig9">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="313" />
<p class="pcap">Augustus Lukeman inspecting work on
Lee&rsquo;s face. Note white model at left.</p>
</div>
<p>Starting April 1, 1925, Lukeman knew he
could never complete the memorial before the
12-year contract would expire in 1928. His hope
was to get enough done to show that he could
and would finish it. So he worked at top speed.
Lukeman made a new design in classic style
showing President Jefferson Davis, General Robert
E. Lee and Lieutenant General Stonewall Jackson on
horseback as the central figures, followed by an
army apparently marching out of the solid rock.
His master model was on a scale of 12-to-1&mdash;one
inch on the model corresponded to a foot on
the mountain.</p>
<p>Lukeman had the curving face of the
mountain blasted off to a vertical wall 305 feet
wide by 190 feet high. Although the steep area
looks almost straight up, the bottom of the cut made
a shelf extending outward 42 feet.</p>
<p>To get his men up against the wall where
they could work, Lukeman had twenty-one
10-inch steel beams placed along the top of the cut,
so they extended 30 feet out into space.
Workmen&rsquo;s scaffolds were suspended from these by
steel cables, with winches to raise and lower
them. A dozen men usually were on the job,
although 42 crowded the scaffolds during one rush
period. Only eight were carvers, the rest helpers.</p>
<p>The sketch of Lukeman&rsquo;s model was painted
onto the mountain by painstakingly measuring all
the component points, so there could be no
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
distortions in the figures.</p>

</div>
<p>Cutting into Stone Mountain had to be done
mechanically since explosives can start a crack
in granite that may run on for many feet. If an
area four feet high by two feet wide needed to
be gouged out two feet deep a jackhammer crew
would drill a row of holes almost touching
each other down the sides and across the bottom,
then a row slanting downward across the top.
Wedges were hammered into the slanting holes
until the block broke loose and plummeted
earthward.</p>
<p>A drill was good for only a few minutes in
the hard granite before its point was dulled,
and a fresh one had to be inserted. The dull drills
were sent by cable and pulley down to the shop
on the ground just out of range of falling rock,
where two blacksmiths were kept busy sharpening
and repairing tools.</p>
<p>Whereas one man can hold a pneumatic
drill straight up and down to break up the paving
in a street, it took four men per hammer to drill
horizontal holes into the face of the mountain. One
guided the drill and held it in place. Two
helped lift the heavy hammer. The operator did his
share of lifting and worked the trigger. All
exerted what force they could to press the drill
into the mountain.</p>
<p>After a figure was blocked out in this
manner, skilled carvers with hand and air-powered
tools completed the job.</p>
<p>Lukeman blocked out the figures of Lee and
Davis and finished their faces and also roughly
outlined Lee&rsquo;s horse, Traveler, before the deadline
of March 20, 1928. It was evident that he was
capable of completing the monument. The
Confederate Commemorative half-dollars were
arriving from the mint, and the way they were
being bought up by the public indicated that
financing the carving would be no problem.
Altogether, 2,314,000 of these coins were struck. A
million were melted back into bullion, and the
rest eventually were put into circulation.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the coins had about as much
material as could be stamped into that small a
piece of silver. On one side were Lee and Jackson
on horseback. Thirteen stars for the thirteen
Confederate States showed above them, and over
this firmament was the slogan, &ldquo;In God We
Trust.&rdquo; At the bottom was &ldquo;Stone Mountain,
1925.&rdquo; On the back side were 48 stars, the raised
image of Stone Mountain with an eagle above it and
Miss Liberty, and printed below, &ldquo;United
States of America Half Dollar. Memorial to the
Valor of the Soldiers of the South.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>The deadline date of March 20 came and
went with no word from the Venables about
extending the contract. On April 9, the 63rd
anniversary of Lee&rsquo;s surrender at Appomattox,
Atlanta&rsquo;s Gate City Guards militia unit hosted an
unveiling of the Lee and Davis features. The
extremely popular Mayor Jimmy Walker of New
York was guest of honor.</p>
<p>On May 20, 1928, the Venables reclaimed
their property, ending the UDC&rsquo;s chance to
complete the memorial.</p>
<p>In 1958 the Georgia Legislature finally got
around to developing the state&rsquo;s greatest tourist
attraction. It named a Stone Mountain Memorial
Association, with authority to purchase the
mountain and surrounding land, 3,200 acres in all,
for a state park, and to complete a satisfactory
Confederate monument.</p>
<p>Nine of the nation&rsquo;s leading sculptors were
invited to visit Stone Mountain and submit
plans for the memorial. The Association approved a
suggestion by Walker Kirtland Hancook of
Gloucester, Mass, for making Lukeman&rsquo;s
uncompleted design appear intentional by carrying
the carving to a point that would be aesthetically
satisfying, a device used effectively by
Michelangelo.</p>
<p>Mr. Hancock was engaged in 1963
and charged with responsibility for finishing the
design according to his plan, for serving as a direct
consultant for the carving, and for developing
the memorial area.</p>
<p>The Association employed George Weiblen,
whose family had operated the quarry at Stone
Mountain, to assemble a crew and get the
mountain ready. In 37 years the steel supports for
the stairway had rusted out and required
replacing, as did the steel cables and scaffolding.
Bids were asked for a 400-foot elevator up to
the carving, and when the costs seemed entirely too
high, a prefabricated elevator was ordered, and
the work crew put it up in 28 days. It was the
world&rsquo;s highest outside elevator.</p>
<p>A skilled carver was hired to begin the
carving. He rode up on the new elevator and
studied from arm&rsquo;s length the acre of granite
which he was expected to fashion into three
horsemen. He found that he simply could not
visualize such gigantic figures at such
close range.</p>
<p>The foreman of the working crew, Roy
Faulkner, a young Marine veteran from nearby
Covington, experimented with the new carving tool
to be used, and discovered he had a knack for it.
Although the foreman had never had an art lesson,
and his only previous experience with stones was
throwing them, he was assigned some smoothing tasks
by sculptor Hancock while the search continued
for an experienced carver. Soon the search was
forgotten. Roy Faulkner stayed on the face of the
mountain for more than six years, to complete
the world&rsquo;s largest carving.</p>
<p>The new tool was the thermo-jet torch
developed for use in granite quarries. It consisted of
an eight-foot pipe fed by three hose lines. One
hose carried kerosene, another oxygen, and
the third water to be sprayed through the jet nozzle
to keep it cool. The operator could adjust the
flame to any temperature up to 4,000 degrees.</p>
<p>When such intense heat strikes granite the
moisture between molecules is suddenly converted
into steam, literally exploding the surface
crystals, or flaking them off, as quarrymen say.
Flakes fell away in a continuous stream. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
coarse, deep gouging, slivers as big as dinner
plates and half an inch thick, sailed off the
mountain like miniature red-hot flying saucers.</p>
<p>One thermo-jet torch could remove several
tons of stone in a day; more than 48 men could
do in a week with drills and wedges. Carving with
it was a one-man job. Two men trying to work
in the same area would have bombarded each
other with hot rocks. Even one could expect some
lumps. Exploding flakes popped out in many
directions, sometimes straight back, or ricochetting
off the mountain or steel cables. The operator
wore a plastic shield over his face, as well as
muffs to protect his ears from the roar of the torch,
which was the dominant sound in the north end
of the Park for six years.</p>
<p>The torch acted like a miniature jet engine,
developing about as much backward thrust as
an automatic shotgun. The carver had to keep his
body braced against this force as long as the
flame was lit.</p>
<p>Fine carving was done with a tool half as
large. With the flame adjusted as thin as an
acetylene torch&rsquo;s, it could cut along a pencil mark.</p>
<p>The carving was continued from Lukeman&rsquo;s
master model, with several important changes
made by Hancock. He stopped the monument
below the riders&rsquo; knees, creating an illusion that
the horsemen were just emerging from the
rough stone. This saved months of carving that
would have produced no more than a view of
horses&rsquo; legs and hooves. The army that Lukeman
planned to have following behind was left off
entirely, making the three leaders the entire
monument. The sculptor lowered the head and
neck of General Lee&rsquo;s horse so that more of
President Davis and his horse could be seen, and
he gave Davis a civilian hat instead of the
campaign hat Lukeman modeled. And, Hancock
modeled a new head of Stonewall Jackson to
make him look more like the photographs
taken just before the General&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Looking at the finished work, it seems
amazing that a man could get his first lesson in
carving on the world&rsquo;s biggest monument, and go on
to complete it. In explaining how he carved,
Faulkner said that mostly he measured. If he was
to start a new feature, like the knuckle of General
Lee&rsquo;s first finger, he measured the distance to
it from his center line on the master model.
Then he checked to get the distance to the
knuckle from Lee&rsquo;s ear, his nose, Davis&rsquo; eye, the
ear tips of the horses, and other spots.
Interpolating inches on the model to feet for the
mountainside, he measured from corresponding
points on the carving. When all the measurements
came out at the same place, he drilled a hole there
to the exact depth corresponding to the distance
from the knuckle to the plumb line at the front of
the model. To insure against cutting away too
much of the adjoining stone, he measured and
drilled depth holes for all of the features nearby.</p>
<p>After making certain that all the measurements
were correct, he fired up the large torch and cut
down to within half an inch of the bottom of the
holes, then switched to the smaller torch to
carve the rest of the way.</p>
<p>He said he always tried to keep in mind the
first fundamental of sculpture&mdash;never cut too
deep nor in the wrong place. He thoroughly
understood that carvers cannot erase mistakes nor
paint over them nor sew them up. The only way
is not to make them.</p>

<p>The jet flames glazed the surface of the
remaining stone, leaving a grayish glassy effect.
This was removed and the whiteness of the
live granite restored by going over it lightly with a
surfacing machine, a vibrating tool driving a
four-point tip.</p>
<p>Roy Faulkner figures that in six years he
drilled thousands of holes in the acre of granite&mdash;more
than ants ever dug in an acre of meadow.
Experience did not speed up the work much. He
was just as careful measuring the last points to
be carved as the first.</p>
<p>There were special models of the heads of men
and horses, on a scale of four-to-one. When
working on a head Faulkner took the
corresponding model up on the scaffold for ready
and frequent references. Incidentally, errors in
the harness showed that Mr. Lukeman&rsquo;s
experience with horses had been purely
academic. He had all the harness buckles
backward, so that a hard pull on the reins would
have made the bridles come apart. The buckles
are turned around right on the mountain.</p>
<p>The sheer side of Stone Mountain would
seem a lonely place to spend six years, but the
man who was up there never found it lonesome.
He had a couple of aides to stretch the opposite end
of the tape measure, help raise and lower
scaffolding and do other jobs, but conversations
could not be heard over the roar of the torch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entire job was one of the most
satisfying experiences anyone could have,&rdquo;
Faulkner declared. &ldquo;In the first place, it was
a privilege to be associated with such a
great man as Mr. Hancock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything about the work was a challenge.
The danger was very real. I was aware every
minute I was up there that a misstep, or a little
carelessness, could drop me to my death. The
wind helped keep me on my toes. When you
hardly noticed a breeze on the ground, it could be
gusting at 50 miles an hour, first into your back,
then bouncing off the mountain into your face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work was hard enough to keep a man
in trim. After leaning against the thrust of that
jet for an hour or two or three, when I turned
off the flame, I felt like taking a rest. There
was enough climbing up and down ladders to
keep legs and lungs in good order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For six years I worried that I might make
a mistake. After coming down in the evenings
I checked over the day&rsquo;s figures in the studio to
make sure they were right. Then I drove home
with them in my head, ate with them, and often
slept with them. The worst dream I ever had
was the time I saw General Lee&rsquo;s head lying in
the ditch at the base of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Among my greatest experiences was, on
several occasions, to look into the stone and
visualize the full outline of the feature I was about
to carve. Then I often got the opposite reaction
just before I finished with a component such as a
horse&rsquo;s eye or nostril. From the close-up view
it seemed to be the wrong shape or in the wrong
place, and up there on the mountain you don&rsquo;t
step back for a better look. It was a relief, on
coming down, to see that it fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I realized at all times that I was carving the
largest piece of sculpture that man ever attempted,
one that would last through eternity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could hardly do anything more
satisfying than that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The earliest history of the mountain was literally
dug up by Lewis Larson, Jr., assistant professor
of anthropology at Georgia State College in
Atlanta. He explored the present bottom of the
lake around the western side while the dam was
being built. Along with more recent artifacts, Mr.
Larson and his helpers collected shards of
soapstone bowls and dishes, carved and used by
Stone Age people possibly five thousand years
ago, long before early Americans learned to
shape and bake pottery.</p>
<p>Local historians have tried hard to find
evidence that Hernando de Soto visited Stone
Mountain. Actually, if that old conquistador had
set out to touch all the points his name has been
associated with, his iron-clad ghost would still
be riding hard and only half way through its
itinerary. De Soto certainly did not see this rock,
or his chroniclers would have described it in
detail as a large-scale replica of the Gibraltar
they left behind.</p>
<p>The first white man to see Stone Mountain
seems to have been Captain Juan Pardo, sent by
the Spaniards in 1567 to encircle Georgia with
forts. He followed somewhat the route taken by
de Soto&rsquo;s ill-fated expedition. Pardo fared some
better. He got back to St. Augustine with his
life, but he did little fortifying.</p>
<p>Pardo regarded as his most important
achievement the discovery of what he called
Crystal Mountain, a great mountain that
glistened in the sun and was surrounded with
diamonds and rubies and other precious stones
lying on the ground for the picking up.
Unfortunately, Indians kept him and his men
too busy for gem collecting at that time.</p>
<p>The captain spent the rest of his life at St.
Augustine trying to raise a force of 500 men for
another trip to Crystal Mountain, promising to
make every one of them rich, as well as any who
would help finance the expedition. Since he
had failed in his fort-building mission and had not
been able to pick up a pocketful of gems, even
when he was walking&mdash;or running&mdash;over them,
he was unable to find 500 men willing to risk life
and fortune on the venture. Pardo&rsquo;s diamonds and
rubies are still to be found on top of the ground
at the base of the mountain. They are crystals of
quartz, fully as beautiful as gem stones, but not
so rare, and therefore not so valuable. Many of
today&rsquo;s visitors, less hurried than the captain
and his men, pick up a few for souvenirs.</p>
<p>The first eye-witness description of Stone
Mountain in English appears to have been an
account written by a British officer and published
in London in 1788. The Britisher almost
certainly came into the area to incite Indians to
fight against the colonists in the Revolutionary
War. Unlettered traders probably viewed it earlier
than that, but seeing no profit, dismissed it as
being of no consequence to themselves.</p>
<p>The mountain enacted its first role in modern
history on June 9, 1790. President George
Washington had sent Colonel Marinus Willet to
confer with chiefs of the Creek Nation and arrange
for an emissary to visit him at the capitol in New
York. In that era of few addresses in the wilderness
the meeting was scheduled for Stone Mountain
as a spot familiar to all the Indians.</p>
<p>The colonel reported in his <i>Narration of the
Military Acts of Col. Marinas Willet</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we found the Cowetas and Curates to
the number of eleven waiting for us. While I
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
was at Stony Mountain, I ascended the summit. It
is one solid rock of a circular form about one
mile across. Many strange tales are told by the
Indians of the mountain. I have now passed all
Indian settlements and shall only observe that
the inhabitants of these countries appear very
happy.&rdquo;</p>

<img src="images/p10.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="386" />
<p class="pcap">Elias Nour and Willard Neal near the top of Stone Mountain</p>
</div>
<p>The colonel could have made us all happier
by setting down some of the stories he was told.
By his failure to do so, those strange tales are lost
forever. Incidentally, even in 1790 the southern
Indians were no longer savage aborigines. They
had been trading with the Spanish, British
and French for more than two hundred years,
had adopted many of the white men&rsquo;s ways and
utterly forgotten much of their tribal lore.
Their extensive farms had grown up in trees and
their elaborate system of trade had been abandoned,
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
while they depended largely for their living on
hunting for furs or hiring out in the white
men&rsquo;s wars.</p>
<p>Head of the Indian delegation at Stone
Mountain was Alexander McGillivray, son of a
Scotch trader and a half-breed Indian princess.
After completing his education in Baltimore,
McGillivray worked in a counting house in
Savannah until the start of the Revolution, then
returned to his mother&rsquo;s tribe in Alabama where
he quickly rose to chief of the United Creeks, and
the Seminoles and Chicamaugas as well. He also
became a colonel in the British Army, in return
for inciting his tribesmen to harass settlers in
Georgia and Tennessee.</p>
<p>After the war ended and the British left,
McGillivray accepted a similar role with the
Spanish in Florida. President Washington sent
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
for him, hoping to placate him and stop the depredations
along the frontier.</p>

<p class="pcap">The assassination of Chief William McIntosh.</p>
</div>
<p>Twelve more chiefs arrived for the meeting at
Stone Mountain, making twenty-three, with a lot
of braves, most of whom were relatives of the
chiefs, and Willet started with them on the
long and colorful procession to New York.</p>
<p>McGillivray accepted payment for his
property in Savannah that had been confiscated.
The Georgia colony already had twice bought
and paid for the land east of the Oconee River,
but McGillivray sold the same land again, and
signed a third treaty for $100,000. For assurance
against further Indian troubles, Washington
commissioned him brigadier general in the United
States Army and awarded him a pension of
$1,200 a year.</p>
<p>McGillivray went immediately to
Pensacola, where the Spaniards proclaimed him
emperor of the Creeks and Seminoles and paid
him $3,500 a year to continue harassing Georgia
settlers. He died in 1793 of &ldquo;gout of the stomach,&rdquo;
which may have been an unidentified poison.</p>
<p>In 1802 the Creeks signed a treaty giving up
their lands west of the Oconee River to the
state line. Georgia then ceded the Alabama and
Mississippi territories to the United States
government in exchange for a promise to remove
all the Indians from within the state&rsquo;s borders, a
pledge that was not carried out. The state
began distributing the land by lottery in 1803.</p>
<p>Reports of the rock that was as big as a
mountain continued to arouse wide interest, but
they were descriptions given by Indians. Few
white men still had seen it. M. F. Stephenson, the
famous gold assayer of Dahlonega, wrote that in
1808 an Englishman returned to London with
the story, but the location of the mountain was
so far from the Blue Ridge peaks that he thought
it was man-made. The president of the Academy
of Arts and Sciences in Paris addressed a letter
to the Hon. R. W. Habersham of Savannah asking
for the dimensions and other data concerning
this vast relic of <i>architectural</i> grandeur.</p>
<p>The frontier continued in turmoil, which
reached a climax through incitement of the
Indians by the British in the War of 1812. In 1814
Andrew Jackson, with 2,500 militiamen and a lot
of Cherokees, cornered and practically annihilated
the militant branch of the Creeks at Horseshoe
Bend of the Coosa River in Alabama.</p>
<p>During the years several more treaties
concerning the Stone Mountain area were signed
and ignored. The Creeks enacted the death penalty
for any chief who disposed of any more of the
tribe&rsquo;s properties. Then Chief William McIntosh
again sold the land between the Oconee and
Chattahoochee rivers for $400,000 in a treaty
signed at Indian Springs in February, 1825. Two
months later he was riddled with bullets from a
hundred Creek rifles.</p>
<p>The next year, in 1826, President John
Quincy Adams invited thirteen Creek chiefs to
Washington and bought the land east of the
Chattahoochee again.</p>
<p>One of the first literate descriptions of Stone
Mountain was written by the Rev. Francis R.
Goulding, noted novelist and inventor, who spent
his later years at Roswell, forty miles away.
Goulding visited the mountain on June 25, 1822,
as a 12-year-old, with his father, a cousin, a
Cherokee guide named Kanooka, and a slave boy
named Scipio. The elder Goulding, a prosperous
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
merchant of Darien on the coast, had just recovered
from a severe spell of fever and recuperated
by taking his son to the mountains to visit
with the Cherokees that summer. Young
Francis wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty miles away to the southeast a vast
prominence of rock loomed in lonely grandeur
above the horizon. It was the great natural
curiosity of the neighborhood, of which we had
often heard and which we had resolved to visit at
our first opportunity. That time had now come.
Indeed, the fame of the great rock had extended to
the Old Country, and had there excited interest
through the representation of a British officer who
had visited and described it as early as the
year 1788.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the time of our visit the country around
had barely passed into the hands of the white
man, and there were few roads and fewer houses
of accommodation. Our tent was pitched beside a
spring near the mountain&rsquo;s base, around the
north and west of which flows a pleasant stream.
From this point the rock rose majestically, with
an almost perpendicular face of a thousand feet.
We enjoyed its rough grandeur almost as much
by the soft light of the moon as we did by the
red light of the setting sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking an early breakfast the next morning,
we made our way first to the eastern side of the
mountain. Here the view was stupendous. A bare,
hemispherical mass of solid granite rose before
us to the height of two or three thousand feet,
striped along its sides as if torn by lightning or
&lsquo;gullied&rsquo; by the action of water through
countless ages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our ascent was effected on the southwestern
side, where the slope is comparatively easy and
where the otherwise baldness of the rock is relieved
by an occasional tuft of dwarfed cedars or
stunted oaks, which find a root hold in the
crevices. These trees, elevated a quarter of a
mile above the surrounding level, seem to be a
favorite resort for buzzards, many of which were
wheeling in graceful flight in the air around,
and a greater number which perched upon dead
treetops, apparently resting from their labors
and watching from the convenient height for
objects on which they might feed in the level
country below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found the summit an irregularly flat
oval about a furlong in length. The view from it
was superb. Not another mountain could be
seen in any direction within a distance of twenty-five
or thirty miles. The country all around seemed
to be an immense level, or rather a basin, the
rim of which rose on all sides to meet the blue of
the sky. To the east and south appeared a few
clearings, but in every other direction the forest
was unbroken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Encircling the summit, at a distance of nearly
a quarter of a mile from its center, was a remarkable
wall, about breast high, built of loose,
fragmentary stone, and evidently meant for a
military fortification; but when erected, and by
whom, we could not learn. Kanooka said that it
was there when his people first came, and that
they knew no more of it than we did. In some
places the stones were almost all dislodged by
persons who had rolled them down the steep
declivity but there were enough remaining to
show that the wall had once been continuous all
around the summit, and that the only place of
entrance was by a natural doorway under a large
rock, so narrow and so low that only one man
could enter at a time, by crawling on his hands
and knees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the mountain&rsquo;s early visitors were
intrigued by the pre-historic wall. Some thought
de Soto might have had it built, without considering
that the aim of the conquistadores was to find
treasure, grab it and run. They were not interested
in defensive strongholds, and certainly not in
building one that would entail carrying thousands
of tons of rock up a steep mountain. All the
early writers described the wall as a cleverly
contrived fortress, since it blocked all trails leading
to the summit. However, the most ignorant savage
certainly would have realized that the top of Stone
Mountain would be untenable in a siege, since
there was no water and no access to food. It is the
last place anyone would want to be caught
when shooting started.</p>
<p>Most likely, the wall had some religious
or ceremonial significance. Toting rocks and
stacking them in a line is the kind of project
ancient medicine men liked to think up to keep
their tribesmen occupied, like building the great
mounds throughout the South and down into
Mexico and South America. Even today it is not
hard to visualize weirdly painted warriors
climbing the mountain in a torchlight procession
and dancing all night around a roaring fire at
the top. Consider, too, the old medicine men&rsquo;s
penchant for human sacrifice. At dawn the
frenzied crowd probably hurled some luckless
victim over the rim, while the women and
children, who had waited below all night to see
the poor devil fall, screamed and cheered, feeling
sure that the gods would be so happy about the
whole thing that they would assure bountiful
crops and good hunting.</p>
<p>Another stone wall stands atop Fort
Mountain overlooking Chatsworth, a hundred
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
miles to the northwest, and it, too, is built at the
edge of a high precipice.</p>
<p>The Stone Mountain wall must have
contained millions of rocks, for there were enough
to let men and boys test their muscles by rolling
stones off the mountain for more than a hundred
years, until Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor, had
the last ones thrown off in 1923 to make sure
vandals did not start them rolling down among
his workmen.</p>
<p>A feature on the mountain top surely as
impressive as the great wall was the Devil&rsquo;s Cross
Roads. This was a tremendous flat boulder roughly
two hundred feet across and five to ten feet
thick, cleft by two smooth, straight breaks making
avenues four feet wide, one running directly
north and south, the other east and west. They
joined at right angles at the center, and directly
over this juncture was another flat rock twenty feet
in diameter.</p>
<p>The Cross Roads became a favorite spot to
have breakfast for parties who climbed the
mountain to watch the sunrise. And everybody
wondered that nature could make a compass as
accurate and a great deal more spectacular than
the ancient Egyptians could do. The entire formation
disappeared in 1896 when quarrymen found
that it was composed of superior building stone
and broke it up and let it down the mountain
by winches.</p>
<p>DeKalb County was founded Dec. 9, 1822.</p>
<p>The DeKalb County courthouse in Decatur
burned in 1842, destroying most of the early deeds
that were on record. There are some interesting
legends concerning early ownership which, because
of the destroyed documents, can neither be proved
nor disproved.</p>
<p>Perhaps the first white settler to claim
ownership of the mountain was John W.
Beauchamp. His descendants still tell how their
great-great-great-grandpa gave Indians forty dollars
and a pony worth about fifty dollars for the big
rock. They say he traded it to Andrew Johnson
and Aaron Cloud for a muzzle-loading gun and
twenty dollars. There are legends that a jug of
whiskey figured in both deals.</p>
<p>If Beauchamp received or gave a bill of sale,
it has not come to light in recent years. He
never explained how the Indians got their claim
to the property. It may have been a sudden
inspiration, conjured up at sight of the jug. No
formal deed could have been available, since the
whole area was still in public domain.</p>
<p>In 1822, the year Francis Goulding explored
the mountain, the State Legislature prepared the
original land grants. The mountain lay in seven
different land lots, which apparently were
awarded to veterans of the Revolutionary War.
One lot went to the orphans of a veteran.</p>
<p>It is said that a man in Athens was awarded
one of the grants. He walked the sixty miles or so to
the mountain to examine his property, and seeing
that most of it was bare rock, he swapped it for
a mule to ride home.</p>
<p>Andrew Johnson, who already had a shotgun
claim to the mountain, was not one of those
receiving grants, but he acquired bona fide title
to considerable land at the base and also the
main slice of the mountain in time to build an
inn, about where the Administration Building is
now, when the stage coach line came through in
1825. The stage ran from the capital at
Milledgeville by Eatonton and Covington to
Stone Mountain, then on by Winder to Athens
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
where the oldest chartered State University was
already dispensing higher education.</p>
<p>Discovery of gold in the Dahlonega and
Gainesville area in 1828, the first deposits
found north of Mexico, brought a boom in traffic
and another stage line from Stone Mountain to
the gold fields. Fare was ten cents a mile, and
since distances were great, the business must have
been profitable.</p>
<p>Everybody bent on mining gold had to pass
Stone Mountain, and any coming back, with or
without new riches, stopped there again. Aaron
Cloud, Johnson&rsquo;s partner in the shotgun deal,
built another inn to take care of the overflow. A
town calling itself New Gibraltar grew up around
the taverns, with general stores, a blacksmith
shop and other services for the traveling public
and the growing farm population.</p>
<p>In that era of typhoid, chronic malaria and
yellow fever epidemics, prosperous planters and
merchants in the lowlands sent their families to the
mountains during the &ldquo;summer miasmas&rdquo;&mdash;the
fly and mosquito seasons we realize now&mdash;and
the most enjoyable part of the trip each way was
the stopover of a day or two at Stone Mountain to
climb the great rock and unlimber kinks caused
by days of rough bouncing in stagecoach or
carriage.</p>
<p>Aaron Cloud was the first to establish a
tourist attraction. In 1838 he paid Andrew Johnson
$100 for &ldquo;150 feet square&rdquo; at the highest point
on the mountain, where he erected a tower 165
feet tall, appropriately called Cloud&rsquo;s Tower. For
fifty cents a visitor who already had winded
himself reaching the summit could climb another
300 steps and get a still higher view.</p>
<p>William C. Richards, a correspondent for
&ldquo;Georgia Illustrated,&rdquo; published in Macon,
wrote in 1842:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This singular edifice, resembling somewhat
a lighthouse, is an octagonal pyramid built
entirely of wood. It stands upon the rock with no
fastening but its own gravity. It was built nearly
three years ago at a cost of $5,000. The projector
and proprietor is Mr. Aaron Cloud of McDonough,
and the work is commonly called Cloud&rsquo;s Tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the lower part is a hall one hundred feet
square fitted up for the accommodation of parties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ascended by nearly 300 steps. The
eyes rest upon a continuity of forest. The
plantations and settlements appear small amid the
sea of foliage. By the aid of good telescopes
we distinguished five county towns. Among the
towns I located was Terminus, a few straggling
huts beyond Decatur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the 150-foot-square plat cost $100,
another old deed shows that Cloud paid Johnson
only $260 for 101&frac12; acres of good forest land
at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Another enterprising showman operated
sometime in the Roaring Forties. His name has
been lost, but some of the work he did can still
be seen. He cut a trail for 250 feet, high up along
the steep face extending out from the Buzzard&rsquo;s
Roost, installed an iron railing, and charged anyone
who had the courage for such an adventure
twenty-five cents to walk gingerly out to the
end and back.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>In one respect the fellow was a hundred
years ahead of his time. He solved the traffic
problem completely. Since only one person
could go out at a time, there was never a jam or
collision. But ambition was his undoing. While
extending his trail still farther he blew himself
into oblivion with a premature explosion of
blasting powder.</p>
<p>Correspondent Richards especially
mentioned Terminus as one of the places he could
see through Cloud&rsquo;s telescope because the magic
new town was very much in the news. In 1842
engineers had just completed a survey to establish
the northernmost route a railroad could be built
from Augusta, the head of navigation on the
Savannah River, around the Blue Ridge
Mountains and on to Chattanooga, a growing
steamboat town on the Tennessee.</p>
<p>Terminus had been renamed Marthasville
and then Atlanta by the time the first train came
over the line in 1845. Most of the town&rsquo;s leading
citizens were waiting at Stone Mountain to
board it for a triumphal ride into their new city.</p>
<p>The railroad had suddenly become so much
more important than the stage line that New
Gibraltar moved over beside the tracks. In 1847
the legislature granted the town a charter as
Stone Mountain and also gave the granite knoll,
which had been called Rock Mountain and Stony
Mountain, the official name of Stone Mountain.
That year a spur track was built from the depot
out to a point between the two inns operated by
Andrew Johnson and Aaron Cloud.</p>
<p>Another historic event took place on that
first train ride from Stone Mountain to Atlanta, in
1845. The local leaders discussed organizing an
agricultural society to promote better farming and
merchandising methods. The first meeting of the
South Central Agricultural Society was held at
the mountain in 1846, with 61 charter members.
The following year the Society held a fair at
Stone Mountain. A Savannah reporter, covering
the event for his paper, wrote: &ldquo;Wagons, carriages,
carts and pedestrians are arriving every minute.
Ladies form a very large proportion.&rdquo; The
correspondent&rsquo;s concluding notation, that he slept in
a room with twenty-eight other people, explains
why the fair was held at Stone Mountain only
two seasons. It was moved to more populous
Atlanta and grew into the great Southeastern Fair,
while the society evolved into the Georgia
Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The Civil War touched Stone Mountain to
the extent that the flow of tourists stopped, and a
detachment of Union cavalry swooped in and
burned most of the town, sending up columns to
join the smoke from Atlanta, Decatur and other
unfortunate neighbors.</p>
<p>Stone Mountain&rsquo;s granite, being too heavy
for long hauls by wagon, had no commercial
value whatever until the coming of the railroad.
The spur line built in 1847 surely hauled rock as
well as tourists. The first official mention of the
granite industry appears on a deed filed in 1863,
when W. B. Wood and John J. Meador sold a
parcel of land, but reserved quarrying rights.</p>
<p>In the Reconstruction Period, when Southern
industry was at its lowest ebb, the granite
quarries flourished. Growing towns needed paving
blocks and curb stones. Buildings destroyed in
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
the war had to be replaced. William H. and
Samuel H. Venable, as the Venable Brothers,
expanded until they had acquired the entire
mountain in 1887, estimating that altogether it
cost them $48,000. The firm operated for seventy
more years, extending the railroad line around to
the east side, where the finest stone was found.</p>
<p>Stone Mountain granite paved principal
streets in most of the Southeastern towns. At the
height of their operation, the quarries were turning
out 200,000 paving blocks and 2,000 feet of curbing
a day. In addition, building stones went into the
Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, the famous Fulton
Tower jail, many post offices, courthouses,
warehouses, and commercial buildings, into the
foundations of skyscrapers, to Panama for the canal
locks; and tremendous blocks of granite were
shipped to the seacoasts from Charleston to New
Orleans for breakwaters.</p>
<p>Will T. Venable, who grew up in the house
nearest the steep side of the mountain, told the
writer of his boyhood there in the eighties for an
article published sixty years later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rarest sight is a rainbow on the
mountain&rsquo;s face,&rdquo; Mr. Venable said. &ldquo;I have seen
but two or three in my lifetime. They can only
appear very early in the morning, since the big
rock faces to the north. The bow always starts on
the ground, climbs the mountain and disappears
on top. It almost makes you believe you might find a
pot of gold up there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it rains, the side of the mountain
looks like a waterfall. The water turns into foam
and literally bubbles down. When I was a
youngster we used to hang our clothes on convenient
limbs and stand under the falls for a foam bath.
It was pleasant while you were taking it, but when
you dried off, you found yourself covered with
very fine, hard sand, which itched like the
mischief. As you look at the side of the
mountain, you see the courses taken by the water
as it pours off. A close-up shows that the water
has eroded little ditches two or three inches deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest show we ever had was the
work on the carving,&rdquo; Mr. Venable continued.
&ldquo;If you have ever stood fascinated while a steam
shovel dug a hole in flat ground, maybe you can
imagine how the work on the mountain kept us
entertained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An incident odd enough to be typical of
Stone Mountain&rsquo;s history took place in 1928, just
after air mail was inaugurated. Little single-seated
biplanes gave overnight service between Atlanta
and New York, at a period when night-flying
instruments were few and crude, and Stone
Mountain lay directly in the path of flight. At the
pilots&rsquo; insistence, a contractor was commissioned
to erect a safety light on top.</p>

<p>Newspapers and visitors took note of the
laborious work of carrying steel poles and wire up
the steep trail, then nothing more was said or
seen of the light until one dark night several
weeks later Pilot Johnny Kytle&rsquo;s plane smashed itself
and nine bags of mail helter skelter up the steep
slope, arousing neighbors for miles around.
The Atlanta postmaster was among those who
rushed to the mountain to help Johnny and his
load of mail back to town.</p>
<p>Then an investigation was launched, to
determine why there was no light on the
mountain. The foreman on the job brought out his
work sheet, showing how he had checked off
each item&mdash;the poles, bolts and braces, the
insulators, the wire, the socket, and the final item,
he had turned on the electricity. But the list given
him had contained no mention of a light bulb,
so he had not screwed one in!</p>
<p>Until the new recreation hall and observation
tower were erected the only construction on top
of the mountain in recent years was a 60-foot-high
forest fire-watcher&rsquo;s tower, manned consecutively
by two women. They drove up every morning
and down in the evening along the foot trail by
Jeep before any semblance of a road was made,
and never had a mishap. If a thundercloud
approached, they came down in a hurry, to
reach the bottom before the storm bombarded the
mountain with lightning.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>Night watching was done by men of the
county fire department, and they made it a point
to go up before sundown and return after dawn.
Trying to come down the mountain at night is a
fearsome experience, say those who have done it.
Every direction looks the same, and the horizon
is just a few yards away, since the rock curves
off into space.</p>
<p>The man most closely associated with Stone
Mountain in recent years is Elias Nour, whose
family operated a restaurant near the foot of the
east trail. When Elias was thirteen he let himself be
lowered at the end of a rope to rescue a boy who
had slipped over the crest and was clinging for his
life to a tiny depression in the rock. Since then
he has rescued thirty-three more persons who
ventured so far down the mountainside that they
could not climb back.</p>
<p>A peculiar thing, he noted, is that hardly any
of the people he saved ever bothered to thank
him. Mostly they seemed embarrassed at having
got themselves into such a predicament, and
they also appeared to think that saving lives was
part of his duties. An exception was a large dog,
that clung whining to the rock until young Nour
reached his side. The dog behaved perfectly
while they were being hauled to safety. Once on
top he jumped upon Mr. Nour so suddenly that
he knocked him down, then licked his face
and neck thoroughly before he was pulled away.</p>
<p>There is no record of the number who have
fallen to their deaths at Stone Mountain, but
it probably is far over a hundred. Some no doubt
were suicides, but the great majority were innocent
victims of the mountain&rsquo;s treachery. The great
dome rounds off so smoothly, and the curve
downward increases so gradually that the
too-venturesome explorer does not realize he is
in trouble until he begins to slide, or attempts
to climb back up. Then he is fortunate indeed if
he can find a tiny crevice or slight depression
that he can cling to until help comes down to him
from above.</p>
<p>One of the first acts of the new Stone
Mountain Memorial Association was to erect a
steel storm fence around the rim of the
mountain, probably about the same location as
the ancient rock wall, as a grim warning that
venturing farther would be courting disaster.</p>

<p>If you wish to see a <i>Hypericum splendens</i>, you will
look for it on the steep slopes of Stone Mountain.
This little hardwood shrub, about three feet tall
with bright yellow blossoms, is found nowhere
else on earth&mdash;not even on the similar, but lesser,
granite outcrops of the area, in DeKalb and
Rockdale Counties.</p>
<p>The <i>Hypericums</i> grow thickest in tiny
crevices about halfway up the mountain and most
are on the southwest side. None are found at
the top nor the bottom. The saucy little golden
blossoms with many stamens are about an inch
across, and they appear in terminal clusters at the
end of branches. Just a few open at a time, so
blooming is continuous through most of June
and July.</p>
<p>The hardy little plant seems immune to
drought and even indifferent to weather. Rain or
shine, hot or cold, has no effect on its growth or
blossoms. But each plant has a life expectancy
of only about three years, after which it dies down
completely, to be replaced by descendants
coming up from seed.</p>
<p>The great whale-shaped mountain of granite,
far from being the bare rock that it appears, is
literally covered with plant life. Thirty specimens
of plants are listed as rare, and many more are so
uncommon or so regional as to be total strangers
to nearly all visitors.</p>
<p>Botanists from Emory and Georgia State
Universities in nearby Atlanta, and the University
of Georgia in Athens, have regarded Stone
Mountain as their special laboratory since the
schools were founded. In 1961 a full-time
horticulturist was employed to live on the
mountain. Harold Cox, from Stratford, England,
studied at the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew.
His assistant, Gerhard Oortman, grew up working
in the magnificent gardens of Eastern Holland.
They have become intimately acquainted with
practically every weed, twig, bush and tree on
Stone Mountain.</p>
<p>They have ascertained that the
<i>Hypericum</i> is the only shrub that grows nowhere
else. Hoping to have specimens where visitors
could recognize them, without running the risk of
having souvenir hunters exterminate the genus,
Cox and Oortman rooted some cuttings in the
greenhouse and set them out in a garden plot
across from the carving&mdash;and saw them promptly
wither and die. However, some seed planted in
the same ground have sprouted and seem to be
thriving.</p>
<p>Stone Mountain&rsquo;s botanical treasures are
governed partly by the seasons and partly by the
amount of soil available. The most spectacular of
the unusual plants is the <i>Viguiera porteri</i>. It is so
rare that it had no common name until the Stone
Mountain natives titled it Confederate Daisy. It
has relatives in Mexico, but the American branch
is confined entirely to Stone Mountain and other
granite outcrops of Georgia&rsquo;s Piedmont Plateau.</p>
<p>The Confederate Daisy grows in swales or
crevices where sand or soil has collected to a depth
of three or four inches to a foot. The plants
would be regarded as skimpy little weeds throughout
spring and summer. A dry summer stunts the
year&rsquo;s crop. But when frequent showers dampen
the mountain&rsquo;s surface, the scrawny plants put
on a big spurt of growth in August. About the
middle of September they burst into great beds of
blooms, making the nearly bare rock look like a
golden meadow. The profusion of color lasts
until mid October.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>In early spring the <i>Diamorpha cymosa</i>
spread like a bright red carpet where soil is half
to an inch deep. The color is in the plants, two or
three inches tall, and in the succulent round leaves.
Tiny white blossoms detract, rather than add, to
the color.</p>
<p>The <i>Amphianthus pusillus</i> has no common
name. It is a member of the snapdragon family,
but is so small that it is rarely noticed except by
naturalists who are looking for it. However, it
leads a remarkable existence.</p>
<p>The <i>Amphianthus</i> lives in the rain pits on top
of the mountain, small sunken areas where water
collects after each shower. When the pit dries
up, the only sign of the plant is a little cyst under
the sand and gravel at the bottom. Immediately
after a rain the cyst sends up a little rosette of
reed-like leaves that stay submerged. From their
midst a thread-like stem arises and sprouts
two leaves half an inch across, that float on the
surface. A tiny bud appears between the two
leaves, and opens into a white flower no more than
one-sixteenth of an inch across.</p>
<p>When the pool dries up, the plant disappears,
quickly turning to dust, except for the cyst,
which waits patiently for the next rain to bring
it back to life.</p>
<p>The <i>Amphianthus</i> is not exclusive with Stone
Mountain. It has been seen on Mount Rollaway
in Rockdale County, but it is missing from some
of the other granite outcrops. Cox called it a
monotypic genus, which means it is represented
by the one genus.</p>
<p>Sharing the larger rain pits are fairy shrimp,
whose lives are frequently interrupted. These
minute crustaceans, hardly more than an eighth
of an inch long, look considerably like ocean-going
shrimp when viewed through a magnifying glass,
and they even swim backward. They disappear
when the pits dry up, and come back soon after the
next rain. It is presumed that all mature specimens
die in the drought, leaving eggs which hatch
when the water returns.</p>
<p>The dark gray color of Stone Mountain is
not the granite, but the lichens which grow on
practically all the weathered stone. Behaving like
booby traps, these pioneer plants have tricked a
number of venturesome climbers to their deaths.
In a rain they absorb water and become quite
slippery, almost as if the stone were coated with
grease. In dry weather they crumble underfoot
and the tiny particles roll like shot to start a hiker
sliding. Walking on almost level ground can
become an adventure.</p>
<p>The lichens are a pioneer plant form, a
symbiotic relationship of fungi and algae. A
fungus, unable to manufacture carbohydrates when
alone, must live as a parasite on another plant.
An alga can manufacture sugar or starch,
provided it is kept moist and has the necessary
ingredients. Working as partners, the fungi absorb
and hold moisture and dissolve some essential
chemicals from the rock; the algae mix these and
cook with the sun&rsquo;s energy to make food for the
partnership. Their assault is the first step in
reducing stone to soil. In this duty they are
followed by grasses, weeds, shrubs and finally trees.</p>
<p>There are three growth types of fungi:
crustose, which appears as thin crusts on the
rocks, and is the most prevalent at Stone
Mountain; foliose, which has leaflike body and
draws almost recognizable pictures; and fruticose,
which stands up in mossy little clumps.</p>

</div>
<p>Stone Mountain has a rare genus of the
crustose, the <i>Pyrenopsis phaecocca</i> which is found
only in Georgia, on the granite outcrops of the
Piedmont section from Atlanta to Augusta.
Another crustose variety is a dull, dark red and
grows in splotches, so it looks as if a boy with a wide
brush had been smearing the boulders with
barn paint.</p>
<p>Some of Stone Mountain&rsquo;s fruticose lichens
stand up like little powder puffs an inch or two tall,
and are comparative to the extensive reindeer
moss of Alaska&rsquo;s tundras. In a long drought
many of the little clumps break off and go
blowing about the mountainside like miniature
tumbleweeds.</p>
<p>Veteran quarrymen have noted that it takes
about 25 years for a freshly broken piece of
granite to weather sufficiently for lichens to grow.</p>
<p>Most spectacular of all Stone Mountain&rsquo;s
plant life are the trees. Gnarled and twisted red
cedars, almost a foot in diameter, cling
desperately to narrow cracks in the deep slopes.
Some are estimated at 500 to 800 years old, and
they look every bit of their age.</p>
<p>Pines, stooped and bent by mountain winds
and stunted by long summer droughts, poke
their roots into rock crevices and strain mightily
to widen the slits. Some of these may be 150 years
old. On the other hand, a giant loblolly growing
in the rich red loam at the foot of the mountain,
near the grist mill, measured nine feet in
circumference, and had only 90 growth rings.</p>
<p>Along the foot trail up the west slope are
tall slim pines growing almost normally in what
appears to be little patches of dirt. There may
be deep loam-filled crevices below, but the health
of the trees in such sparse soil attests to the rich
mineral content. High up on the eastern slope,
where a little silt has accumulated, is a small
pine forest called Buzzard&rsquo;s Roost.</p>

</div>
<p>A rare tree is the <i>Quercus Georgiana</i>, or
Georgia oak, which grows, but hardly
flourishes, on Stone Mountain and neighboring
outcrops. It has small glossy leaves two or three
inches long, and tiny acorns. Few grow taller
than about 25 feet.</p>
<p>Where enough dirt collects there may be
blackberries, huckleberries, and muscadine vines.</p>
<p>Songbirds flock in great numbers to the
gardens and groves around the foot of Stone
Mountain, but there is little wild life up on the
rock, itself. The soaring birds, such as vultures
and hawks, are well acquainted with the updrafts
which lift them skyward like elevators when the
wind strikes the steep, smooth slopes, and they
know where to find the best rides for each
direction the wind blows.</p>
<p>While the memorial was being carved,
workmen noticed a large hawk that soared by
at eye level nearly every day, apparently quite
interested in what they were doing. The men
began leaving scraps of food at a certain place near
the top of the carving. The bird flew in for lunch
every afternoon, and he did not seem to mind
if the men were working quite near. However,
the loud roar of the jet torch disturbed him.
When it was in operation he delayed his lunch
until the flame was turned off.</p>
<p>The workmen placed their lunches in a
locker in a shed at the foot of the mountain
every morning. They began finding the latch
unfastened and the tastiest sandwiches missing,
and soon identified the thief by footprints in the
dust&mdash;a raccoon. A more intricate latch kept
the coon out of the locker. The men put out
food for him, and he always picked it up after
they were gone, but he did not fare as well
on charity as he had done while stealing.</p>
<p>Stone Mountain has birds and bees and
shrimp and lizards, but no snakes. Harold Cox
reported that he had not seen a single one in all
his years there.</p>

<p>Stone Mountain, sixteen miles east of Atlanta, is
the world&rsquo;s largest exposed granite monolith.
It is as great a wonder to geologists today as it was
to Indian medicine men of ancient times. While
geologists know how it was formed and what
it is made of, they still are amazed at its
tremendous size, its wonderful symmetry and its
location, high and alone on a gently rolling
plateau over thirty miles from its nearest
mountain neighbor.</p>
<p>This mountain is a perfect example of the
unbelievably powerful forces and the eternal
patience of nature, for it was a million years in the
making and lay a hundred million years incubating
before it arose like a great egg on a vast plain
in another hundred million years.</p>
<p>Stone Mountain is 1,683 feet above sea
level, and 825 feet above the surrounding land
which is itself a dividing ridge. Rain water
running off the eastern slope goes into the lake
and out by the Yellow River. That on the west
finds its way to South River. The streams join 50
miles away at Lake Jackson and flow on by
the Ocmulgee and Altamaha to the Atlantic
Ocean. Three or four miles to the north, headwaters
of Peachtree Creek start their long trip to the
Gulf of Mexico by way of the Chattahoochee and
Apalachicola.</p>
<p>The exposed granite of Stone Mountain covers
25 million square feet, or 583 acres. A surveyor
figured the mass at 7,532,750,950 cubic feet.
Since that time several million cubic feet have
been quarried and shipped away, but all of man&rsquo;s
endeavors show as insignificant peelings taken from
the western and eastern slopes. Granite weighs
167.9 pounds per cubic foot, if you are interested
in computing the weight of Stone Mountain.</p>
<p>Granite is the universal stone, containing
practically all the natural elements from uranium
and aluminum to iron and silica and the
rarer minerals. It decomposes into fertile soil, as
is readily seen by the growth that springs up
where a little dirt and moisture collect on the
gentler slopes of the mountain.</p>
<p>Stone Mountain is near the foot of the
Appalachians, an extremely ancient mountain
chain originally composed of granite gneiss. The
peaks, in their youth, rose much higher than the
brash young Rockies, or even taller than the
Himalayas. Three hundred million years ago, when
Stone Mountain was born, the land in the
area stood perhaps 10,000 feet higher than it
does now.</p>
<p>During a period that may have lasted a
million years or more, molten stone under
tremendous pressure was pushed upward from
deep in the earth. If the force behind it had been
sufficient to drive it out at the surface, the rock
would have cooled rapidly and would have assumed
a different form.</p>
<p>The weight of two miles or so of rocks
and earth overhead was sufficient to contain the
tremendous pressure of the molten flow, so the
upper crust literally floated on a hot liquid base.</p>
<p>Something had to give as liquid rock thrust
into an area where there was no space. Forty
miles or so to the northwest is a chain of
mountains, of which Kennesaw is the tallest,
formed by pressure from the side which
buckled underlying rocks up like a steep roof, or
folded layers over each other. Some of that pressure
may have been applied by Stone Mountain. This
admittedly is theory&mdash;upper layers which held much
of the factual story have long since washed away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Since the intruding material was contained
in its original prison cell and held under constant
pressure, it cooled gradually, a process which
took perhaps a hundred million years. By cooling
slowly, the molecules formed compact, uniform
crystals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the older, softer granite overhead
was weathering and turning to soil and eroding
away. Some went to extend the coastal area of
southeast Georgia and some to help build up
the rich black belt of South Alabama.</p>
<p>In the two hundred million years since the
intrusion, the two-mile-thick overlay has eroded
down to its present level, leaving the hard core
of Stone Mountain standing up like a great gray
egg. The surface of the mountain wears very
slowly&mdash;scuffing feet of millions of visitors have
left barely discernible marks along the western
trail. Meanwhile the original crust is still wearing
away at a rapid rate, so Stone Mountain is
continuing to grow taller in reference to its base.</p>
<p>Around the base have been noted fingers of
Stone Mountain granite extending outward into the
old rock, or sometimes soil, where the molten
material was forced into crevices during the
lateral movement of underground strata.</p>
<p>The mountain is a natural target for lightning.
Thunderclouds bombard it with their heaviest
artillery. A bolt of lightning behaves very much like
the thermo-jet torch. Its extreme heat converts
moisture in underlying molecules to steam and
literally blasts off the surface crystals, making a slight
saucer-shaped depression four to six inches across.
Heat fuses the bottom of the depression, leaving
a slick, glassy surface.</p>
<p>Every lightning bolt for many years has left
its mark. It is noticeable that they are thickest not on
the highest points, but in depressions. Meteorologists
say that is where the first drops from a shower
soak into the granite and therefore make the best
ground to attract the lightning.</p>
<p>From the time Gutzon Borglum began
carving in 1923, stone rubble piled up at the
base of the mountain below the monument. Hardly
a man alive could remember what lay under it.
After nearly fifty years, when the rubble was
removed, there was revealed a low hill of the
original granite gneiss peeping out from under
the mountain, or more accurately, pushing into
its side. The old rock clearly shows how it was twisted,
turned and tortured by the great pressures of
two hundred million years ago. Unable to shove
aside this lot of rock, the molten mass tried to
engulf and digest it.</p>
<p>We see only the tip top of Stone Mountain. The
shape around the base that will be revealed when more
of the surrounding rock erodes away in the next
million years is anybody&rsquo;s guess. The depth surely
is infinite, for it is still connected down through
the channel by which it spewed upward.</p>
<p>Stone Mountain is unique. Chemical makeup
of the granite, and its physical characteristics,
are different enough from all other stone in the
Southeast to indicate that this is the only portion
of that ancient flow of molten rock that has yet
reached the surface.</p>
